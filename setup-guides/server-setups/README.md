## Choosing the correct guide:

There are two guides available depending on the server host you use.

Because the majority of users prefer to use Minehut as their server host, a dedicated setup page has been created specifically for Minehut users who want to host their server on this platform. Otherwise, I recommend using the Standard Host page.

{% content-ref url="standard-host-setup.md" %}
[standard-host-setup.md](standard-host-setup.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="minehut-setup.md" %}
[minehut-setup.md](minehut-setup.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

# ðŸ’¾ Standard Host Setup

{% hint style="info" %}
This page walks you through setting up my server setup on the majority of server hosts. If you are using Minehut, please follow the specialised guide [here](minehut-setup.md).
{% endhint %}

## 1. Create your Zip File

Find the server files in your downloaded files from BuiltByBit or Polymart. You should be able to find the directory that looks similar to the following:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Select all the files and add them to a ZIP file. I recommend using 7Zip for this, but any zipping program should work.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## 2. Upload to your Server

* Once you have a ZIP file of your server files, shut down your server and connect to it via FTP or SFTP (contact your server hosting provider if you don't know how to do this).
* You then need to delete/cut all the server files out of the main directory of your server. If you want to keep these files, you'll have to put them in another folder or download them somewhere else.
* Upload your newly created ZIP file to your server host. It should be the only file on there.
* Unzip the file; it should create many files in the main directory. Once the file has been unzipped, the .zip can be deleted.

## 3. Download a Server Jar

You will now need to choose a server jar for your server to run. You can use any spigot fork you wish; however, I suggest paper for simplicity. If your server host has a built-in jar downloader, you can use that, ignore this step and proceed using that.

Download the correct jar for your server (you can find the correct version to use on [this](../../miscellaneous/resource-versions.md) page). Upload this to your root folder for your server.

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is extremely important that all server setups are run using the specific versions as shown on [this](../../miscellaneous/resource-versions.md) page. Failure to comply with this requirement may lead to the failure of the world to load if an earlier version is used or the inability of certain plugins to function if a later version is used. To enable connectivity for clients utilizing different versions, the use of [ViaVersion](https://hangar.papermc.io/ViaVersion/ViaVersion) and [ViaBackwards](https://hangar.papermc.io/ViaVersion/ViaBackwards) is recommended.
{% endhint %}

## 4. Plugin Dependencies

Because of licensing restrictions with specific plugins used in the setups, you will need to download some independently and add them to your `/plugins` folder. You can find links to these here:

* [TAB Plugin](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/releases)
* [Citizens Plugin](https://ci.citizensnpcs.co/job/Citizens2/)
* [BetterBalls Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/82787/) (Only for Lifesteal Setup)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are setting up the Lifesteal Setup and wish to utilize the LifestealCore integration, please see the setup guide [here](../../miscellaneous/lifestealcore-integration.md).
{% endhint %}

## 5. Agree to the EULA

You will need to accept the [Minecraft EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) by going into the `eula.txt` and changing `false` to `true` to start the server.

## 6. Starting the Server

You can start the server and enjoy your premade setup. Please be aware that the startup may take longer for the first time, as it needs to generate the necessary files.

Due to how pre-made server setups are created and delivered, you will probably find that when you first log in, there are a lot of plugin updates. I recommend updating these if you can to avoid any issues further down the line.

## 7. Styling your server

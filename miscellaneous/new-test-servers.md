# New Test Servers

## How can I use them?

When viewing any of my resources on BuiltByBit, you can click on "Testing Server" at the top to view the information. Upon clicking "Generate Test Server", a completely fresh version of the setup will be generated for you to play around in!

{% hint style="info" %}
Requesting a test server will duplicate the original files and provide you with a new server for you to join and experiment with for up to 30 minutes. Any changes you make will not be served, so feel free to play around! (Or blow everything up).
{% endhint %}

## Why make this change?

With the old test servers, players were not able to be opped (for the safety of other players). Using this solution allows everyone to be able to play around with the setup fully and, mainly, making sure you know what you will receive upon purchase!

{% hint style="danger" %}

These terms are subject to change without notice, and you are responsible for keeping updated with any changes.

1. Redistribution of a resource as your own is strictly prohibited.
2. Usage of any resource without a valid license is strictly prohibited and will result in a lack of support and a permanent ban from the Discord Server.

4. The product cannot be resold privately or used on servers/accounts not owned or administrated by you.
5. In case of any disrespectful or rude behaviour from your end, the product license can be revoked.
6. We do not promote piracy, cracked Minecraft or any other illegal content. This means you will NOT get support if your server is using offline mode without a proxy that is using online mode.

10. If you submit a negative review due to a bug or server fault and have not requested support, your review will be reported and removed.
11. By purchasing a resource, you are acquiring a copy of the resource, and modifying or adding additional content does not make you the owner.
12. Support is provided only for core features, not to help you create or add new ones. If you require support for adding a new feature or have issues with the features you added, it will not be provided.
13. Upon launching a server with the resource, you become the server owner, "thomaskeig" is not the server owner. The development, setup, and configuration files are owned by "thomaskeig".
14. Use of any of my resources to create a new product to resell is not allowed.
